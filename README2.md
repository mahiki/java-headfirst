### headfirst java
*a mild book for learning java basics*

This is a good place to start, nothing like the sedgewick treatment of learning java.  Sheesh.

Things I wanna learn:
 - [ ] object oriented programming structure
 - [ ] using libraries
 - [ ] using HashMap (**everybody uses it *all* the time**

##### creating this repo with command line
I created the repo locally, then created the remote repo using:

```
curl -u 'USER' https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"REPO"}'
# Remember replace USER with your username and REPO with your repository/application name!
git remote add origin git@github.com:USER/REPO.git
git push origin master
```

The -u will cause github to prompt for user/password, rather than storing it in .bash_history.
